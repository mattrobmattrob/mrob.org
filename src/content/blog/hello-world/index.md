Welcome to my blog. This is the first post, built with [Astro](https://astro.build).

## Why Astro?

Astro is a modern static site generator that:

- Ships zero JavaScript by default
- Supports Markdown and MDX out of the box
- Has excellent TypeScript support
- Generates fast, static pages

## Code Example

Here's a simple JavaScript function:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

Looking forward to writing more here.
